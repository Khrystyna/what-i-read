  <p>Books have always been a big part of my life. They made me believe into magic when I was little. They made me wonder about how huge and different this world is when I was growing up. They keep making me believe in power of love, doing good and following your dreams ♥️ </p>

Hi, my fellow reader! My name is Khrystyna Skvarok and this is my small digital library!

<a href="https://khrystyna.github.io/what-i-read/">👉 Here 👈</a> you can find a list of books I have read (and i think are interesting to share), I am reading and will be reading soon. I believe it tells a lot about you - what makes you spark, what is important to you, how you see this world and life around you.

If you have any suggestions, please please please send it to me 🤗 I am always hunting for something interesting to add to my reading list.
